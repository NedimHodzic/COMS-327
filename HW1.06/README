This is my solution for 1.06, it checks the pyrite data base first then it checks the home one and if
it does not find the files in either it prints a message saying that it could not find them. I tested
in pyrite and it worked on my computer.

To run the code:
	First type make.
	Then ./poke327 file where file is which csv you want to check. The names should correlate
	with what they are on the assignment spec.

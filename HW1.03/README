This is my solution to printing out all the path finding weights. I started off with using my own code but could not get it
to work so I switched over to using Sheaffer's code for 1.02. I then made my dijkstras method and weight methods to print
out the 2 maps for each NPC. Since this is Sheaffer's 1.02 I had to change a few things around, like the position of the
print map in the main method, and I also commented out the do while loop because I only wanted to print the weight maps
one time. First I print the normal map, then the hikers distance, then the rivals.

Note: I am not sure If my small screen made the map print different but in my testing, there was one time where it looked
like the clearing weights did not print properly. It has only happened once so I probably mis saw it but I figured I would
say something in case.

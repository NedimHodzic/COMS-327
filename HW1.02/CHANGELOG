02/09: Started work on the project. Worked step by step completing the easy stuff like getting the users choice first and
moving on tothe harder parts after. Near the end of my work I had struggles with the program just terminating when going
out of bounds but I found the fix. Once that was complete I just free'd the memory and finished the code.

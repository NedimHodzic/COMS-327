This is my solution to the world creation problem. First I took my code for making the map and copied it into this file.
To start I went to understand how the array of pointers worked with the map struct and I also went and changed somethings
in my orignial code like making the map in a struct rather than in main. When going in a direction I have it so the x and y
is changed depending on what movement was being performed. My approach to checking for neighbors happens when I am making
the exits for that map. It first checks each of its 4 neighbors to see if that is null and if not it takes its exit. Then
after that I checked if the current position of the map was at an edge of the world, if it was I replaced the exit with a
rock ('%'). I also made a method to do the distance math for the buildings and it gives back a percent, then in the
method that generates the math a random number is used, and if it is below that percent it prints the building. Then at the
end of my main method any memory that was used up is freed.

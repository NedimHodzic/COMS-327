This is my HW 1.08 solution. All the proper functionality is implemented like battles and using the
bag. The trainer starts with 10 of each item so if they run out its game over. To access the bag
outside of battle use 'B'.

Note: Due to there being no PP or struggle, sometimes you can get stuck in an infinite battle if both
your Pokemon and the enemy trainers Pokemon have no damaging moves. To avoid this, make sure that
when picking a started you choose one with an attacking move, or to catch a wild Pokemon that has one
before battling.

To run the code:
	First type make.
	Then ./poke327, it should run the game normally. All parsing is done automatically.

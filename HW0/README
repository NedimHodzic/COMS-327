My code correctly displays all 1728 possible Knight's Tours given a 5x5 grid. To make sure it did I tested that the
example given in the pdf appeared and it did. In my code it cycles through an array with 0's in every location,
filling the current location with the order that it has been check. Once it has gone through every location on the board,
it then cycles through the now filled array printing out the locations in the order they were traversed.

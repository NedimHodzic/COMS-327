03/09: Started the assignment, got to the point where it can take user input for how many npcs and it
also places down the npcs. Also managed to get the pacers and random walkers moving. I need to stop
procrastinating.

03/10: Got back to work. Started off by re-doing my npc struct and instead made it a character struct
to include the player character. Then I managed to get the priority queue to work to move the
characters. I am able to move all the characters. I also added color.

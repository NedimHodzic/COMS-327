This is my solution to HW 1.07. I implemented all the proper functionality like printing the moves
and stats. I did a similar process to last HW where it looks directly in the Pyrite database. I
tested it on Pyrite and it worked on my device. Instead of using 19 like he said, I used 18 and 20
because I am pretty sure using both contains every Pokemon. I did extensive testing and had no issues
once I included testing but there may have been something that I missed. Using both also lets every
Pokemon have moves instead of some having no moves, unless there are Pokemon not part of 18 or 20.

To run the code:
	First type make.
	Then ./poke327, it should run the game normally. All parsing is done automatically.
